## Geospatial AI for Hazard Laboratory

GAIA HazLab is a comprehensive platform dedicated to advancing hazard assessment through the integration of machine learning, geospatial analytics, and data-driven approaches. Our mission is to provide researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders with the tools and resources necessary to understand, predict, and mitigate natural hazards.

## Platform Overview

This documentation is organized into five main sections:

### 🎯 [Problem Statement](chapters/problem_statement)
Understand the challenges and objectives in hazard assessment. We define the key research questions and goals that drive our platform development.

### 📊 [DataHub](chapters/datahub)
Access our centralized repository of hazard-related geospatial data. The DataHub provides datasets, data management tools, and documentation for working with hazard data.

### 🤖 [ModelHub](chapters/modelhub)
Explore our collection of machine learning models and algorithms designed for hazard prediction and analysis. Find pre-trained models, training pipelines, and model evaluation tools.

### 📈 [HazEvalHub](chapters/hazevalhub)
Utilize our frameworks and tools for evaluating hazard assessments. The HazEvalHub provides validation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarking capabilities.

### 📚 [Resources](chapters/resources)
Access additional resources including tutorials, references, publications, and community contributions.
