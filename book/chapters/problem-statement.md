# Problem Statement

## Overview

Landslides after atmospheric rivers, liquefaction after storms, catastrophic runoff after fires—the next generation of geodisaster risk emerges from interacting climate and solid-Earth processes. But our models cannot yet keep pace with these nonlinear cascades. We need a leap: a platform that merges multimodal Earth observations with real-time AI reasoning, reduced-order physics models, and self-updating digital twins. This project builds that platform.

Natural hazards pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems worldwide. The GAIA HazLab platform addresses the critical need for advanced, data-driven approaches to hazard assessment and mitigation.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Data Integration and Accessibility

- Hazard data is often scattered across multiple sources and formats
- Lack of standardized data formats makes integration difficult
- Limited access to high-quality, up-to-date hazard datasets

### 2. Model Development and Validation

- Traditional hazard models may not capture complex spatial and temporal patterns
- Need for machine learning approaches that can handle multi-scale hazard processes
- Difficulty in validating models across different hazard types and geographic regions

### 3. Real-time Assessment and Prediction

- Challenges in developing systems that can provide timely hazard warnings
- Integration of real-time sensor data with predictive models
- Computational constraints for large-scale hazard simulations

### 4. Uncertainty Quantification

- Quantifying and communicating uncertainty in hazard predictions
- Accounting for data limitations and model assumptions
- Providing actionable information despite inherent uncertainties

## Research Goals

Our platform aims to address these challenges through:

1. **Integrated Data Management**: Creating a centralized DataHub for hazard-related geospatial data
2. **Advanced Modeling**: Developing and deploying state-of-the-art ML models in the ModelHub
3. **Robust Evaluation**: Establishing comprehensive evaluation frameworks in the HazEvalHub
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Building a community of practice through shared resources and tools

## Impact

By addressing these challenges, GAIA HazLab seeks to:

- Improve the accuracy and reliability of hazard assessments
- Enable faster response times to emerging hazards
- Support evidence-based decision-making for risk mitigation
- Foster collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers
