# Mountain to sea: sediment transport

**Team**: [Marine Denolle](https://denolle-lab.github.io), Akash Kharita, Nate Stevens, Alex Hutko, Brad Lipovsky, Shuyi Chen, Abby Swann, Patrick Johnon, Hadrien Sablon, Brendan Jerns, Richard Zhang, Kate Huntingon, David Montgomery, [Nicoleta Cristea](../website/people.html).

**Meeting Time**: Thursdays 1:30pm.

**Meeting location**: JHN 375 and Zoom.

This use case is to characterize the AR-River-Sediment coupling during the 2025 storms.

Challenge from Skagit: 3 dams, 1 unregulated, most of the hazards is way upstream.


Data to be collected:
* Weather data for rain
* River Gage from USGS
* Seismic noise, PSD> 5 Hz?
* Drone imagery of flood extent
* Soil structural models.


Previous flood in Skagit in 2021

Precipitation data:
* Comparison of rainfall gridded products.
* Comparing flood forecasting.


Hypothesis to test:
* Landslides are triggered by precipitation o0r precipitation rates threshold
* Landslides upstream aggravate the floods downstream in series of atmospheric storms
* The hydromechanical history/memory of soils is a leading contributor to the landslides and flood severity.
