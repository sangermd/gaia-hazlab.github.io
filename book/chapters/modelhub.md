# ModelHub

## Overview

The ModelHub is a comprehensive collection of machine learning models and algorithms designed for hazard monitoring, prediction, and analysis. We aim to provide pre-trained models, training pipelines, and tools for developing custom hazard assessment models.

## Models

### Hazard Prediction Models

- **Weather Forecasting**, coupling ACE2 with Amtmospheric River Index (Richard Zhuang and Brandon Kerns), and Clima-X (Aditya Grover). Examples of AR tracking and forecast [here](https://orca.atmos.washington.edu/~bkerns/realtime/ar/)
- **Heatwave Forecasting** (Greg Hakim)
- **Storm Detector**, detecting thunderstorm from seismic and weather data using deep learning ([Akash Kharita](../website/people.html), Alexandra Anderson-Frey, [Marine Denolle](https://denolle-lab.github.io))

- **Earthquake Wavefields**: deep learning models for data-driven full wavefield and peak ground motions reconstruction (nowcasting) and forecasting (lead [Yiyu Ni](https://niyiyu.github.io/))
- **Ground Failure Modeling**: Surrogate model to predict liquefaction and ground failure potential index (lead Morgan Sanger), and its coupling to wavefields ([Yiyu Ni](https://niyiyu.github.io/) & Morgan Sanger)
- **Large Earthquake Detection**: deep learning model to detect earthquakes are strong ground motions in seisbench ecosystem.

#### Flood Hazard Models
- **Flood Forecasting**: Flood forecasting using stream gauge data, SWE, and meteorological products.
- **Flash Flood Detection**

#### Landslide Susceptibility Models (TBD)
- **Data-Driven Reduced Order Modeling** of Landlab modeling for landscape evolution/erosion and debris flow modeling. 
- **Susceptibility Mapping**: Random forests and gradient boosting for landslide susceptibility
- **Triggering Models**: Models linking precipitation and seismic triggers to landslide occurrence
- **Run-out Prediction**: Neural networks for estimating landslide travel distance
- **Landslides Detection** using high temporal resolution of multi-sensor geophysical networks (seismic, infrasound, tilt, DAS) and high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery (sentinel+SAR) with [Akash Kharita](../website/people.html), Scott Henderson, and collab with AI2.

- **Hydromechanical Model** data-driven approach to turn multi-sensor raw data (non co-located seismic, geodetic, meteorological sensors) into real time hydromechanical properties ([Manuela Köpfli](../website/people.html))
<!-- - **Cascading Hazard Models**: Frameworks for modeling hazard interactions -->
<!-- - **Compound Event Models**: Statistical and ML approaches for compound hazards -->
<!-- - **Risk Assessment Models**: Integrated models for multi-hazard risk assessment -->

## Model Architecture

This is the draft of a common framework.
### Deep Learning Models 

```python
# Example: Using a pre-trained flood detection model
from gaia_hazlab.models import FloodDetectionModel

# Load pre-trained model
model = FloodDetectionModel.from_pretrained('flood-v1.0')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(satellite_image)
```

### Traditional ML Models

```python
# Example: Landslide susceptibility mapping
from gaia_hazlab.models import LandslideSusceptibility

# Initialize and train model
model = LandslideSusceptibility(algorithm='random_forest')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate susceptibility map
susceptibility_map = model.predict_map(terrain_features)
```

## Model Development

### Training Pipeline

Our standardized training pipeline includes:

1. **Data Preparation**: Automated data loading and preprocessing
2. **Feature Engineering**: Domain-specific feature extraction
3. **Model Training**: Optimized training with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Validation**: Cross-validation and performance evaluation
5. **Deployment**: Model packaging and versioning

### Custom Model Development

Create custom models using our framework:

```python
from gaia_hazlab.models import BaseHazardModel

class CustomHazardModel(BaseHazardModel):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Custom initialization
        
    def train(self, data):
        # Custom training logic
        pass
        
    def predict(self, inputs):
        # Custom prediction logic
        pass
```

## Model Performance

### Benchmarking

All models in the ModelHub are benchmarked against:
- Baseline models (traditional statistical approaches)
- State-of-the-art published methods
- Domain-specific metrics and standards

### Performance Metrics

We evaluate models using:
- **Classification**: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall
- **Regression**: RMSE, MAE, R², Bias
- **Spatial**: Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient
- **Probabilistic**: Calibration, Brier score, Log-likelihood

## Model Registry

### Model Versions

- All models are versioned using semantic versioning
- Each version includes model weights, configuration, and metadata
- Reproducible training environments documented

### Model Cards

Each model includes a comprehensive model card with:
- Model description and intended use
- Training data and preprocessing steps
- Performance metrics and limitations
- Ethical considerations and biases
- Citation and attribution

## Deployment

### Model Serving

Deploy models for inference:

```python
# Deploy model as API endpoint
from gaia_hazlab.serving import ModelServer

server = ModelServer(model='flood-detection-v1.0')
server.start(port=8000)
```

### Batch Processing

Process large datasets efficiently:

```python
# Batch prediction
from gaia_hazlab.batch import BatchPredictor

predictor = BatchPredictor(model='landslide-susceptibility-v2.1')
results = predictor.process_dataset(input_data, batch_size=32)
```
